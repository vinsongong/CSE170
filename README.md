## Main Functions
This app has two main functions, it helps the user learn how to do specific exercises and it reminds the user to perform exercises or actions throughout his or her day. In addition to some preset ‘recommended’ exercises that our team incorporates into the app, the user can create customized exercises or actions that they can perform along their work. The user would schedule an exercise at a certain frequency and for how long. When it comes time to perform these exercises, the app will remind the user in intervals throughout the day.
